<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>This is where I get to share my hobbies here. This is where what I do in my
free time.</p>
<h2>Hiking</h2>
<img src="Hiking.jpg" title="Hiking" width="500" height="333"><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiking is a hobby I like doing. It is because I like to go outside and look at
nature. I like to look at the sights and take the time to look at the view. It is worth it because
I would be tired at the end. I can just look back and see how far I came.</p>
<h2>Drawing</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing is a hobby that is fun to do. Through drawing, I get to express myself
and show it. I am not the best artist though, but I can still put hard work into my drawings. I am
a person who believes thoughts are best expressed through drawings.</p>
