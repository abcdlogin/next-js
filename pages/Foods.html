<h1>Foods</h1>
<p>I have a lot of foods that I like to eat. I will show the foods that I like to eat.</p>
<h2>Pizza</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a food where you can put anything on it and it's still pizza. You can add meat,
veggies, sweets, etc. I personally like to put meat and veggies on my pizza. But that is
the thing, you can put anything on a pizza.</p>
<h2>Sushi</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like pizza, it can be any fish with anything on it, and it's still sushi. I like to eat
sushi because of the variety. There is a lot of stuff to get prepared, which I also like about that. It used
to be such a delicacy, but now it can be accessed by a lot of people is what makes me happy.</p>
