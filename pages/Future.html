<h1>Future</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is what I am going to do for my future. I will be
going to high school. I will get my diploma and go to a good college or university.
After I get my degree, I will move out and get a job. I don't know what to do afterwards,
but I will keep my eye out.</p>
