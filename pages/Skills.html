<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>I have a couple of skills that I will be showing off.</p>
<h2>Listening</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have good listening skills. I can listen very well to
directions. I can also listen to any sound that is being said.</p>
<h2>Trust</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a trustworthy person and I never tell any secrets.
I am also trusted to do any task. I think that honesty is the best policy,
even if its the bad truth.</p>
